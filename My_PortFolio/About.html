            <p>Ever since I wrote my first line of code, I knew technology was my thing. The thrill of solving problems, breaking things (only to fix them again), and watching my ideas come to life through code kept me hooked.

                I'm a final-year B.Tech student in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, with a strong passion for full-stack development. Over time, Iâ€™ve worked with Java, JDBC, SQL, MongoDB, Node.js, React, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, building web applications that solve real-world problems.
